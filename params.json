It will take the resulting file from ``raspiyuv -rgb``\r\nand convert it into a ``.bmp`` bitmap file.\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nDownload the jar release (preferably) or compile this to a .class file.\r\nCd to the directory of the jar/class\r\n\r\nAs Jar:\r\nThen run ``java -jar rgb2bmp PATH/TO/IMAGE/`` and let it go! Use the complete path to the **folder**, not a\r\nspecific image. This will create an ``output`` directory in that path and save the images there.\r\n\r\nAs class:\r\nThen run ``java rgb2bmp PATH/TO/IMAGE``. Otherwise the same as above.\r\n",
